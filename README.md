# SmokeDetector Regex Testing

---

SmokeDetector Regex Testing (SDRT) provides functionality for testing regexes
against [metasmoke](https://m.erwaysoftware.com) data and analyzing their results.

It makes heavy use of the [Polars](https://pola.rs) library, which it uses to
store post data, test regexes, filter results, and more.
